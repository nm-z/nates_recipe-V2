LESSONS LEARNED
===============
1. Always clean up branches after PR reviews (forgot this initially)
2. PR review must be complete - check until no PRs remain
3. Preserve critical documentation (TODO.md, AGENTS.md structure)
4. Environment setup is critical - libraries must be properly installed
5. Test basic functionality before assuming everything works
6. Update documentation immediately after major changes
7. Create memories for important processes to avoid forgetting
